		Expose RenderStateShard inner classes (#7895)
		
		In 1.17, all of the inner classes of `RenderStateShard` (`RenderStateShard.OverlayStateShard`, `RenderStateShard.WriteMaskStateShard`, etc.) have been changed to protected. These classes are needed however to create new `RenderType.CompositeRenderType`'s using `RenderType.CompositeState.CompositeStateBuilder`.
		Since these are protected inner classes, their constructors also can't be directly be obtained using `ObfuscationReflectionHelper`.
		
		Currently, any mod using custom `RenderType`'s will have to either:
		- add their own access transformer for the inner classes, or
		- extend `RenderStateShard` to access `RenderStateShard`'s inner classes, and extend `RenderType` to access `RenderType.CompositeRenderType`
		
		This PR changes the visibility of `RenderStateShard`'s inner classes to public in Forge's `accesstransformer.cfg`.
